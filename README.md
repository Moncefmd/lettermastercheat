# lettermastercheat
Quickly hacked together script to cheat on letter master

The script utilizes a trie which can check for the validity of any word in the dictionary (francais.txt). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie

Everything in the script could probably be a lot more efficient, but hey, it works well enough !

### Usage :
Simply run main.py with python 3 and enjoy your cheating.

### Note : 
You may have to install some dependencies (pip install unidecode)
